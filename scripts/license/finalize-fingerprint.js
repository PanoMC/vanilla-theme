/**
 * Post-build step for Pano themes — runs AFTER `vite build` has fully finished.
 *
 * Computes the stable cumulative SHA-256 of every file in `build/` (except manifest.json)
 * and stamps it into `build/manifest.json` as the `fileFingerprint` field. The Pano host
 * re-runs the same hash on install + every theme start, refusing premium themes whose
 * extracted folder doesn't match.
 *
 * Why this is a separate node script and not a vite plugin:
 *   SvelteKit's adapter-node makes vite emit the SSR bundle and the client bundle in two
 *   passes. A vite plugin's `closeBundle` hook fires after EACH pass, so if it runs after
 *   the first pass the second pass's files aren't on disk yet and the digest is taken on
 *   an incomplete tree. Running the hash from package.json's `build` script (after
 *   `vite build` returns) guarantees both passes are done.
 *
 * Triggered by `package.json` scripts:
 *   "build": "vite build && node scripts/license/finalize-fingerprint.js"
